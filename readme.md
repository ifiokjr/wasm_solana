## Description

## Contributing

[`devenv`](https://devenv.sh/) is used to provide a reproducible development environment for this project. Follow the [getting started instructions](https://devenv.sh/getting-started/).

To automatically load the environment you should [install direnv](https://devenv.sh/automatic-shell-activation/) and then load the `direnv`.

```bash
# The security mechanism didn't allow to load the `.envrc`.
# Since we trust it, let's allow it execution.
direnv allow .
```

At this point you should see the `nix` commands available in your terminal.

Run the following commands to install all the required dependencies.

```bash
install:all
```

This installs all the node dependencies, cargo binaries and solana tooling locally so you don't need to worry about polluting your global namespace.

### Upgrading `devenv`

If you have an outdated version of `devenv` you can update it by running the following commands. If you have an easier way, please create a PR and I'll update these docs.

```bash
nix profile list # find the <index> of the devenv package
nix profile upgrade <index>
```

### Editor Setup

To setup recommended configuration for your favorite editor run the following commands.

```bash
setup:vscode # Setup vscode
```
